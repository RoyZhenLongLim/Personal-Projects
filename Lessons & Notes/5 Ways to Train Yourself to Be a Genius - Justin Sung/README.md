# 5 Ways to Train Yourself to Be a Genius

## Defining what a genius is
The genius that the author is referring to is an academic genius.
- There are other times of geniuses like being emotionally intelligent and street-smart.
- However, these will not be covered.

### Traits of a genius

There are two primary traits that make a genius, those being:
1. Memory
2. Understanding

## How to improve your memory and understanding

### 1. Encoding

The best way to improve your memory is a good encoding of the information the first time something is learnt.

#### 1. Start at higher orders of learning as soon as possible

Refer to Bloom's taxonomies
- Apply is applying the concepts to problems
- Analyze means to draw connections between ideas
  - For instance, what are the differences, similarities between two concepts
  - How does this idea fit in with other ideas?
- Evaluate
  - Provide a judgement, critique, argue against or for.
- Create 
  - Design something or assemble something together based on how they fit together

### 2. Deep Processing

The ability to take an information and look at the bigger pictures.
- Activates higher order learning (there are 4 levels below)
	1. Priorities/judgements
		- Connecting groups and debating which ones are more relevant to the task at hand
	2. Create relationships and groups
	3. Information and how its related or applied to a few more concepts
	4. Just taking information at face value (isolated information is not learnt efficiently)

### Ways to train

#### Step 1: Going up a level in your own learning level (Short-Term)

Figure out what order of learning you are currently at  
A good way to verify which level you are at is Bloom's and SOLO Taxonomies.  
Bloom's Taxonomies (Left most is the highest):
```markdown
Create <- Evaluate <- Analyse <- Apply <- Understand <- Remember
```
**or**  
SOLO Taxonomy
```markdown
Extended Abstract <- Relational <- Multi-structural <- Uni-structural <- Pre-structural
```

First tip: Start incorporating more of learning on a higher order after you figure out which order you are currently on

#### Step 2: Pre-study Structure (Short-Term)

Any study before lecture
- Layout a basic organisational structure
- Spend a small amount of  time to learn about the big ideas
	- Take 3-4 main idea and see the link between the topics
		- Figure out the 2-3 sub-ideas for each main idea

#### Step 3: Delay notetaking (Short-Term)

Taking notes immediately offloads the responsibility of remembering onto the paper rather than forcing your brain to
absorb it
- Hold on to the information in your brain first and then write it down
- When it makes sense, write in your own word

#### Step 4: Increasing the cognitive load tolerance (Long-Term)

Increasing cognitive load just means to increase the time you are thinking about a certain topic
- Specifically when you are uncomfortable/ when you are trying to figure out a really complicated topic
- Can be done by incorporating higher order learning 

#### Step 5: Critical Reflection of your technique (Long-Term)

Critically reflect on what components of your learning is helping or holding you back
