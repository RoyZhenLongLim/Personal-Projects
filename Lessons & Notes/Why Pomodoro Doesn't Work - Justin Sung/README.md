# Why Pomodoro Doesn't Work

## What is the Pomodoro Technique and why does it work?

First, the pomodoro technique is segmenting study into 25/5 min work/break time blocks.
- By putting time pressure, the technique improves concentration

### The issues surrounding the technique

- The time increments are arbitrary
  - The time is based off a tomato timer
- Doesn't specify what the break is for/what to do during the break

## How to improve the technique

The way to improve the technique is to work and rest for an ideal amount of time.  

### Work Time/Length

For the amount of time we work, we want to stop when our efficiency drops below 50%. This is because of a multitude 
of factors:
- Firstly, we do not want to train our brain to work at a suboptimal level of efficiency
- Secondly, if we work at lower efficiencies, we will need more time to rest and recover

Since the goal is to work as much as possible with minimum breaks to maintain efficiency, we need to ensure that we 
are always working efficiently.

Hence, it is ok  to break a study session short if you feel like your focus is shortening.
- This means that over the course of the day, the amount of time you work/rest will shift as you become more fatigued.

### Break Time/Length

Breaks as a rule of thumb should be around 1/3 or 1/4 the time spent working.

### Optimising Work Time 

Set micro-goals for each session

### Optimising Break Time

Some good break-time practises are:
- Mediation
- Walking while connecting ideas in your mind
- Doing something productive in order to maintain a flow state
