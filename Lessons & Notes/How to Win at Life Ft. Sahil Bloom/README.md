# How to Win at Life Ft. Sahil Bloom
## Life Story

- Started at Stanford
- Very academically inclined family
- Went into a finance role after university, but it wasn't a match after a few years
- Because of Covid, went from 90-100 hrs/week and travelling 3-4 days a week to writing significantly more
- Started writing about finance
    - Make some abstractions to make it easier
- Humans are bad at understanding exponential growth
    - This makes long term plan very difficult due to exponential growth
    - Any strategy you created will be wrong within a month

## Advice for just starting out with content creation

- Consistently intense
    - Need to find a way to writing something on a consistent basis in sprints
- Find something you really want to write about that you can sustain for a long period of time
    - Think of it in terms of inputs and outputs
    - What are you consuming on a daily basis, turn that into writing and output

## Saying yes/no to opportunities

- In your 20s, it's the time of the life to saying yes to opportunities
    - You don't know much
    - Don't say no to things that might be a massive passion
    - Impossible to predict what is interesting
    - Time to massively expand your serendipity surface area
- In your 30s, time to start saying no to most
    - Double down on what would yield some output

Overall
- Say yes to things when you are young and gradually start saying no

## Coping with "being behind"

- The world belongs to generalist and creativity
    - For some people that are exceptional, they can specialize, but they are a minority

## Personal branding and building credibility

- People still care about your degree now
- In 5 years, your credibility will be dependent on what you have done
- Focus on building and creating rather than credentials
- Talent is equally distributed but opportunity is not
- Create your own credibility
    - Established by contributing to other people

## Networking and building relationships

- Networking sounds so transactional
- Humans are social creature
- Be curious and interesting in others
- Transactional networkers will not work because its so obvious
- Pursue more relationship with no expectations
- This supports the idea that you can create your own luck
    - Put yourself in position where you can take advantage of opportunities

## If you were graduating right now...

- Talk to the smartest people that you know and get them to tell you what they are most excited about
- Figure out what your game is
    - Figure out what you are going to be great/good at
    - Not about following a path that someone has laid out for you but discover your own path
