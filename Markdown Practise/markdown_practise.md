Headings use "#"  
The heading will depend on how many "#" are used

Make sure that you use two spaces otherwise the test will not wrap.  
Like so!
See how this doesn't get wrapped

## Gaps ##

If you  need to create extra breaks, you can use br like in html  
For example,
<br>

you can do this

## Horizontal Lines ##

----
