# Companies that I would like to work at: Research

## Taylor Fry

### What does Taylor Fry do?

Taylor Fry is a firm primarily focused on actuarial work.
- In summary, this means the company focuses on insurance
  - E.g. General, Health, Self-insurance to name a few

### Why does Taylor Fry appeal to me?

A large part of what makes Taylor Fry attract to me is the diversity of people and their backgrounds.
- While research the company, I browsed through the a brief introduction of the team.
- One of the things that I immediately noticed was the wide array of backgrounds, ranging from ones that I expected
  (actuarial science) to ones that I wasn't very familiar with (biochemistry).
- I think it is amazing to be surround by incredibly smart people from diverse backgrounds.

Another aspects is the work.
- Actuarial work is known to be quite interesting.
- I want to be able to work/challenge myself to implement all of what I have learnt
  - Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Math, Statistics, Problem Solving, e.t.c.
  - I should constantly be pushing the boundaries and what I can capable of.
- For me personally, I would be more interested towards health insurance as I can see a very clear link between the
  pricing of the products and the benefits
  - The price should be low so that is affordable and help cover any costs individuals may have
  - ey should also be high enough such that the framework behind the scene should be maintained and improved to deliver
    better healthcare outcomes in the long run

### Things that I am not sure of

- If I were to work at Taylor Fry, I would need to study for the actuarial exams.
  - Would I be limited in the work I can do before I complete my actuarial exams?
  - I am assuming I will need to study while working, are there any exam subsidies?
    - From what I know exams are expensive :(
  - Is there any difference in pay between an accredited actuary and me if I have not gotten an accreditation?
- I have done some research on the people in the company, most notably an individual that does not come from an
  actuarial background (Aidan Robern).
  - Would I be able to do actuarial work even tho I do not have a degree in actuarial science?
