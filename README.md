## Summary of projects
### Data Science Projects

- [Titanic Competition (Ongoing)](https://github.com/RoyZhenLongLim/Personal-Projects/tree/master/TitanicCompetition)
  - **Key Skills**: Python, Pandas, Machine learning using Scikit-Learn
  - Trained a machine learning model to predict survival of passengers on the Titanic 

### Research that I have undertaken
- [Investigating Deep Mixing within Red Giants Branch Stars](https://github.com/RoyZhenLongLim/PHYS1200)
  - **Key Skills**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Machine Learning using Scikit-Learn.
  - This project involved using Juypter Notebooks and packages such as Pandas, Sklearn (machine learning package) and Matplotlib to investigate a currently poorly understood phenomenon in stars (v cool owo).
 - [Applications of Quantum Monte Carlo Method (SQA Undergraduate Research Scholarship)](https://github.com/RoyZhenLongLim/SQA_Undergraduate_Research_Scholarship)
   - **Key Skills**: Theoretical Research, LaTeX   
   - Project involved learning about quantum computing. In particular, a new algorithm was invented using Grover's Algorithm as a base which provided a quadratic speed-up to determining the mean of a random variable provided the "source code" for generating the samples and quantum access. This project involved independent research into the applications of the quantum algorithm.
