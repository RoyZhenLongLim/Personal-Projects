# Roy Lim's Personal Repository
## Data Science Projects

- [Titanic Competition (Ongoing)](https://github.com/RoyZhenLongLim/TitanicKaggle/tree/main)
  - **Key Skills**: Python, Pandas, Machine learning using Scikit-Learn
  - Trained a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic 

## Research that I have undertaken
- [University Class Scheduling Algorithm](https://github.com/RoyZhenLongLim/COMP4121/tree/main)
  - Self-directed project done as a part of coursework in COMP4121
  - **Key Skills**: Python, Numpy, LaTeX
  - Self-directed research project into how universities create timetables for their students.
  - Investigated and implemented a variety of contemporary exact and approximate algorithms for solving NP-Hard/NP-complete problems
- [Investigating Deep Mixing within Red Giants Branch Stars](https://github.com/RoyZhenLongLim/PHYS1200)
  - Supervised by [A.Prof Sarah Martell](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/associate-professor-sarah-martell)
  - **Key Skills**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Machine Learning using Scikit-Learn.
  - Trained various machine learning models to predict the mass of stars using their stellar parameters (such as effective temperature and surface gravity).
  - This was used to investigate potential causes of poorly understood phenomena within Red Giant Branch Stars called Deep Mixing.
 - [Applications of Quantum Monte Carlo Method (SQA Undergraduate Research Scholarship)](https://github.com/RoyZhenLongLim/SQA_Undergraduate_Research_Scholarship)
   - Supervised by [Dr Cl√©ment Canonne](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/clement-canonne.html)
   - **Key Skills**: Theoretical Research, LaTeX   
   - The project involved learning and finding applications for a new quantum algorithm based on Grover's Algorithm.
   - With access to the "source code" of a random variable, the algorithm can achieve a quadratic speedup in determining the mean of the random variable.
   - Applications range from pricing financial derivatives to improving property testing algorithms.
