## Summary of projects
### Data Science Projects

- [Titanic Competition (Ongoing)](https://github.com/RoyZhenLongLim/Personal-Projects/tree/master/TitanicCompetition)
  - **Key Skills**: Python, Pandas, Machine learning using Scikit-Learn
  - Trained a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic 

### Research that I have undertaken
- [Investigating Deep Mixing within Red Giants Branch Stars](https://github.com/RoyZhenLongLim/PHYS1200)
  - **Key Skills**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Machine Learning using Scikit-Learn.
  - Trained various machine learning models to predict the mass of stars using their stellar parameters (such as effective temperature and surface gravity).
  - Mass was used to investigate a currently, 
 - [Applications of Quantum Monte Carlo Method (SQA Undergraduate Research Scholarship)](https://github.com/RoyZhenLongLim/SQA_Undergraduate_Research_Scholarship)
   - **Key Skills**: Theoretical Research, LaTeX   
   - The project involved learning and finding applications for a new quantum algorithm based on Grover's Algorithm.
   - With access to the "source code" of a random variable, the algorithm can achieve a quadratic speedup in determining the mean of the random variable.
   - Applications range from pricing financial derivatives to improving property testing algorithms.
