# Intro

This is a folder dedicated to showcasing my data analysis and machine learning
capabilities which are demonstrated using Kaggle's Titanic Competition where,
given a set of data, you must predict who will survive the historical event
(pretty cool aye!). I will document the struggles I experience and how I
overcame them.  
I have also included code to demonstrate what type of coder I am.  
Please see documentation for a more in-depth explanation of the data used.

# Struggles

## Knowledge

Prior to this competition, I had some experience in data analysis, primarily
from the actuarial science part of my degree since I need to do R coding.
However, for this competition, the language used Python and in particular,
Pandas, which is a package specifically for data analysis. Since I wasn't
familiar with the concepts, I was forced do a brief course on it on Kaggle. In
addition, the competition required you to submit a prediction based on what data
analysis, which required machine learning knowledge, which I had no experience
with, meaning I had to do another mini-machine learning course in my own time on
Kaggle.
